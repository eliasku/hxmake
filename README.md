### First install
1. Install library

`haxelib git hxmake https://github.com/eliasku/hxmake.git`

or clone source code and install as `dev` version

`haxelib dev hxmake path/to/hxmake`

2. Build hxmake and install command-line alias

`haxelib run hxmake _`

Enter system password if required to install alias

### Usage
`hxmake` - run hxmake

`hxmake _` - rebuild hxmake tool and reinstall command-line alias

`hxmake all arguments you need` - usage

`hxmake idea haxe` - run `idea` and `haxe` tasks for project

### Running steps and environment
1. Linked modules are scanned from current-working-directory (Haxe compiler)
2. Build scripts class-path are added at compile-time (Haxe compiler)
3. Compiled make program is running (Haxe interpreter or Neko stand-alone application)

# Status
Is under development

# What is hxmake about
1. Delivering make scripts and building tasks for Haxe projects
2. Haxe language for everything: makes, tasks, plugins, whatever
3. Should run on MacOS / Windows / Linux

### Cache your make program cases

You able to add `--haxe` to arguments, in this case hxmake will be runned in compile-time on `macro` context,
By default file `make.n` will be generated and executed with your current `neko`. This program will include all your built-in arguments,
but you able to run it with additional arguments. You need to recompile your make if you modify your make-scripts or
change your project in multi-module perspective.

Regular make program:

`hxmake` - just build your make program

`neko make.n test --override-test-target=js` - for example, run your make program with additional arguments

Specified make program:

`hxmake test --override-test-target=js` - build make program which will always run `test` task for `js` target

`neko make.n  --override-test-target=flash` - and run your `test` task, but for `js` and `flash` target

### Logging

`--verbose`: include all TRACE and DEBUG messages

`--silent`: disable all messages from `hxmake` code

Use `MakeLog.*` methods for logging in your tasks.
